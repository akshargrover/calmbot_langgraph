I\u2019m juggling college exams, a part-time job, and taking care of my younger sibling because my mom is unwell.

My motivation is gone, and I can\u2019t even enjoy the things I used to. I don\u2019t know if I need therapy or just a break, but I feel like I\u2019m at my breaking point.", "agent_output": "Based on what you're experiencing, I think speaking with a therapist could be helpful.
